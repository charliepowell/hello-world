# hello-world
My first repository

Welcome to my first repository!

It's my second day at Valtech, and what is becoming apparent is that I have an absolute buttload of stuff to learn! 
I'm feeling positive about it because everyone here is nice and seems genuinely interested in us. Let's hope I can learn fast and not disappoint.
